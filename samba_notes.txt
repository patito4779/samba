Steps to install and run samba on ubuntu linux

1. sudo apt install samba
2. sudo mv /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
3. sudo systemctl stop smbd
4. cd /etc/samba ; sudo nano smb.conf
5. Enter the following statements below into the smb.conf file:
[global]
server string = File Server
workgroup = WORKGROUP  # This should be the name of the workgorup (domain)
security = user  # This is a user level security
map to guest = Bad User # This means that the user accont will nnot be required for this connection
name resolve order = bcast host  # This is the order for searching for host names
include = /etc/samba/shares.conf  # This includes another file in this config file
6. sudo nano shares.conf (Enter the following below into the file: )
[Public Files]
path = /share/public_files
force user = smbuser
force group = smbgroup
create mask = 0664
force create mode = 0664 # windows permissions do not work same as linux, this fixes permissions issues.
directory mask = 0775

[Protected Files]
path = /share/private_files
force user = smbuser
force group = smbgroup
create mask = 0664
force create mode = 0664 # windows permissions do not work same as linux, this fixes permissions issues.
directory mask = 0775
force directory mode = 0775
public = yes
writable = no

7. Let us create the directory that we are to be sharing.
sudo mkdir -p /share/public_files # This is the parent directory
sudo mkdir /share/private_files
8. sudo groupadd --system smbgroup 
9. sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --group smbgroup -s /bin/false smbuser # this prevents the user from logging in and no home directery
10. sudo chown -R smbuser:smbgroup /share
11. sudo chmod -R g+w /share # This gives write access to the 
group.
12. sudo systemctl start smbd # to start the service or restart the service if you did not initially stop it.
